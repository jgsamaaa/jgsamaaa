**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Gamer)`**

I'm a curious human being that got in to the tech world by playing Dota 2. I once wanted to be a game developer but I found joy in making websites with beautiful designs.
Now currently sharpening my skills to deliver more user friendly websites and to impress my friends.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª JGsamaaa's COding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a Dota 2 player. I got really addicted to Dota 2 that I wanted to become a pro but the luck is not on my side as I was stuck on 7k MMR, I just didn't have the talent that the other players have. So I decided to shift my interest in Game development and wanted to work as a game developer and hopefully one day work for Valve and help develop Dota 2, but as I got in the tech world my interest shift to Web development. One time I ended up helping my friend make a website using HTML, CSS  and JavaScript, after we made that project I asked him to teach me more about CSS as I already have knowledge about HTML and Javascript(HTML I learned during my highschool, Javascript learned by watching UDEMY).My CSS skills that time is just pretty bad so he taught what he learned about CSS and the rest is history no just kidding I still suck at CSS. CSS opened my mind in the world of designs that really got me in Web devepment. As of now I code mostly every day, getting better day by day. I'm a big dreamer and I know this year is the  year that I can make my self proud. Cheers.
